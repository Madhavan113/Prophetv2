# Security Analysis: Prophet Bonding Curve System

## Overview
This document analyzes the security properties and potential attack vectors for the Prophet bonding curve implementation. The system implements a cost-function-based AMM (C(s) = c·s^k) for minting/burning ArtistTokens against ProphetToken reserves.

## Attack Surface Analysis

### 1. Mathematical Precision & Overflow Risks

#### Risks
- **Integer overflow** in power calculations for large supplies or high exponents
- **Precision loss** in fixed-point arithmetic during curve calculations
- **Rounding errors** that could be exploited for arbitrage

#### Mitigations
- ✅ **MAX_EXPONENT = 10** prevents unreasonable exponential growth
- ✅ **Binary search** for inverse calculations avoids direct power root computation  
- ✅ **SCALE = 1e18** provides sufficient precision for financial calculations
- ✅ **Bounds checking** on coefficient (MIN_COEFFICIENT = 1e12) prevents zero-cost tokens
- ✅ **SafeMath equivalent** through Solidity 0.8+ overflow protection

#### Residual Risks
- Large trades with k > 3 may encounter precision limits
- Binary search convergence assumes well-behaved curves

### 2. Economic Manipulation

#### Price Oracle Attacks
- **Risk**: No external price oracle dependency reduces oracle manipulation risk
- **Mitigation**: Curve prices are deterministic based on supply

#### Front-running & MEV
- **Risk**: Sandwich attacks on large bonding curve trades
- **Mitigation**: Slippage protection via `minArtistAmount`/`minProphetAmount` parameters
- **Recommendation**: Consider commit-reveal schemes for large trades

#### Liquidity Draining
- **Risk**: Rapid sell-offs could drain Prophet reserves below operational levels  
- **Mitigation**: Reserve tracking per artist prevents cross-contamination
- **Emergency measure**: Admin `emergencyWithdraw` function for stuck funds

### 3. Access Control & Permissions

#### Admin Key Compromise
- **Risk**: DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can manipulate curve parameters post-deployment
- **Mitigation**: Consider timelock for critical parameter changes
- **Current**: Immediate effect on `initializeCurve` calls

#### Bonding Curve Role Security
- **Risk**: Unauthorized mint/burn if BONDING_CURVE_ROLE is compromised
- **Mitigation**: Role-based access control with explicit permission checks
- **✅ Implemented**: Dual authorization (BONDING_CURVE_ROLE OR DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)

### 4. Re-entrancy & State Consistency

#### Cross-function Re-entrancy
- **✅ Mitigated**: `nonReentrant` modifier on `buyArtist`/`sellArtist`
- **✅ Checks-Effects-Interactions**: State updates before external calls

#### Reserve-Supply Mismatches
- **Risk**: Prophet reserves becoming inconsistent with minted artist tokens
- **Mitigation**: Atomic reserve updates within same transaction as mint/burn
- **Invariant**: `prophetReserves[token] == integral_of_curve(0, totalSupply)`

### 5. Griefing & DOS Attacks

#### Gas Limit Attacks
- **Risk**: Binary search could be forced into high iteration counts
- **Mitigation**: Upper bound estimation limits search space
- **Bound**: `high = currentSupply + 1e12 * SCALE` prevents excessive computation

#### Factory Spam
- **Risk**: Unlimited artist token creation could bloat state
- **Mitigation**: Consider factory creation fees or rate limiting in production

## Economic Security Properties

### Bonding Curve Invariants
1. **Monotonic pricing**: Price always increases with supply for k > 1
2. **Conservation**: Buy then immediate sell never profits (minus gas)
3. **Reserve backing**: All artist tokens backed by Prophet reserves

### Parameter Safety Bounds
- **Coefficient**: c ≥ 1e12 (prevents near-zero initial prices)
- **Exponent**: 0 < k ≤ 10 (prevents overflow and ensures reasonable curves)
- **Supply limits**: Binary search bounds prevent runaway calculations

## Deployment Security Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] Verify all contracts compile with optimization enabled
- [ ] Test curve calculations with extreme parameters (k=1, k=10, large supplies)
- [ ] Validate round-trip buy/sell invariants
- [ ] Test slippage protection with various market conditions

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Set reasonable default curve parameters in factory
- [ ] Grant minimal necessary permissions to factory contract
- [ ] Consider multi-sig for admin functions
- [ ] Monitor for unusual trading patterns

## Upgrade Path Considerations

### Future Math Improvements
- Curve logic isolated in BondingCurve contract
- New curve types can be deployed without touching artist tokens
- Consider proxy pattern for curve upgrades while preserving reserves

### Breaking Changes Protection
- ProphetMarketplace interface remains unchanged
- Existing artist tokens continue functioning with original curve parameters

## Emergency Procedures

### Incident Response
1. **Pause mechanism**: Admin can halt new curve initializations
2. **Emergency withdrawal**: Recover stuck tokens via `emergencyWithdraw`
3. **Reserve isolation**: Each artist token has separate Prophet reserves

### Recovery Scenarios
- **Curve parameter error**: Deploy new BondingCurve, migrate via factory
- **Token contract issue**: Emergency withdraw reserves, coordinate manual migration
- **Market manipulation**: Slippage protection limits individual trade impact

## Audit Recommendations

### High Priority
1. Formal verification of curve mathematics for overflow conditions
2. Economic modeling of extreme market scenarios
3. Gas optimization review for binary search implementation

### Medium Priority  
1. Integration testing with ProphetMarketplace for edge cases
2. Long-term economic simulation with various artist adoption rates
3. Multi-block MEV attack scenario analysis

### Low Priority
1. Code style and documentation completeness review
2. Event emission optimization for off-chain indexing
3. Storage layout optimization for gas efficiency
